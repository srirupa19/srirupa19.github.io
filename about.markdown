Iâ€™m Srirupa Datta (IRC: sriru:matrix.org), a third year undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering at Jadavpur University, India.

This year, I have decided to take part in Season of KDE and will be working on extending the Ellipse Assistant Tool to add support for Perspective Ellipse in Krita.
